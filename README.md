# **Animal Shelter Database System**

## **Overview**
This project involves the development of a database management system for an animal shelter, aimed at streamlining operations such as animal intake, adoption, and medical record management. The system was built using **SQL on Oracle Cloud**.

## **Key Objectives**
- Analyze data requirements to define **entities** and **relationships**.
- Create an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** based on the schema.
- Implement **normalization** for data integrity and use **stored procedures/functions** to manage data efficiently.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **SQL**: For database creation and management.
- **Oracle Cloud**: Used to host and manage the database.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: For designing and visualizing the database schema.
- **Stored Procedures & Functions**: For efficient data handling and automation.

## **Workflow**
1. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data requirements to identify essential tables and relationships.
2. **Schema Design**: Create the **ERD** and define the schema based on the identified entities and relationships.
3. **Normalization**: Apply normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and optimize storage.
4. **Stored Procedures/Functions**: Implement stored procedures and functions for efficient data manipulation.
5. **System Implementation**: Build and deploy the database system to streamline the shelter's operations.

## **Results**
The database management system significantly improved the efficiency of managing animal shelter operations, including intake, adoption, and medical record tracking, ensuring better data integrity and quicker access to records.
